# SimonGame

Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

The Website simulates the device, so you can play SimonGame without carrying the device.

This Website is the online version of the Simon electronic game device with its circular design and its 4 big illuminated buttons: red, green, blue and yellow. Each coloured button is linked to a sound which will help the player to memorize the series of illuminated keys.
